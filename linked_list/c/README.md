# Circular Doubly Linked List Implementation

This code implements a circular doubly linked list in C with various operations.

## Changes Implemented

1. Fixed the `removeLast` function:
   - Corrected memory deallocation by properly freeing the node to be removed
   - Added proper pointer management to maintain circular structure
   - Added return statement after freeing the only node in single-node case

2. Refactored the `insertAfterX` function:
   - Simplified logic using a do-while loop to search the entire list
   - Added memory allocation failure check
   - Fixed memory management by freeing allocated node when using helper functions
   - Updated tail pointer when inserting after the tail node

3. Improved the `removeX` function:
   - Added specific handling for single-node lists
   - Added clearer messages about which element was removed
   - Simplified logic with a do-while loop for traversal
   - Consistent error messages when elements are not found

4. Added Memory Management:
   - Implemented a new `freeList` function to properly clean up memory when program exits
   - Updated the main function to call freeList before returning
   - Added memory allocation failure checking

5. Refactored code style:
   - Removed else statements throughout the code
   - Used early returns for cleaner control flow
   - Added proper structure to functions for better readability

## Additional Improvements

1. Added error handling for memory allocation failures
2. Implemented proper circular list traversal using do-while loops
3. Added informative messages for user feedback
4. Added comments to clarify the circular list operations

## Future Enhancements

1. Consider adding bounds checking for user input
2. Add a search function to find elements in the list
3. Implement a count function to track the number of elements
4. Add a function to check if the list is empty
